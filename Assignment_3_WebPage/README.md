# Introduction

I am Diya Patel and this is my own work. I have developed a web page for my assignment 3 on the topics of assignment 1 and assigment 2. 

## Learnings.

I have applied the learnings and skills of github, visual studio code, html, css and java script which i have gained in week 10 to 13. 

### Stuff included in Assignment.

I have created the web page on data analysis where i have added 5 picture which correspond to the 1st image which can be seen in the web page with some text by clicking their buttons. 

Have used 2 different themes which can be changed by just one click on the buttton. Added the java script for showing users name in the heading when it is entered and greating the user with a hello.

Also added a java script code for the users to see the current date and time when they open the file. 

Finally, the local storage is used to remember the user's theme preference and name of the user so that if the user opens the page again it shows the last thing he/she leaved. The page remebers the last name entered and the theme they were in so that they get the same. 

 # List of Assignment.

 1. HTML file - Toggle.html
 2. README file for the brief details about the project
 3. base.css file for CSS
